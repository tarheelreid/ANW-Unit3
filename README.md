# ANW-Unit3
This is a repository containing all of the material and data-sets from Reid Miller's Unit 3 project for Prof. Gotzler at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

This repository contains:
1. In-class tutorials. 
2. My first Python and Pandas Package test runs.
3. My chosen .csv file of all of the American Ninja Warrior Obstacles to use for Unit 3's assignments.

The .csv file of American Ninja Warrior's Obstacle History was found at [Github's Awesome Data](https://data.world/ninja/anw-obstacle-history).

I chose this file to manipulate and work with because it was very interesting when I first saw it. It caught my eye as I was reading through some sports data sets found on Github and I thought it would be a great file to work with for my first time coding with Python.

This database is made for fans of The American Ninja Warrior competition generally interested in obstacle information. Any athlete training for the competition wanting to prepare for what the next competiton may bring. And lastly, American Ninja Warrior competiton makers who want to know their history of creating obstacles in order to create good obstacles for the coming competitions.

These materials have been taught by Prof. Gotzler and adapted from the great resources of UNC's Davis Library found at the [Research Hub](https://unc-libraries-data.github.io/Python/Intro/Introduction_CrashCourse.html)
