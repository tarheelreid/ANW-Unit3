# American Ninja Warrior: Obstacle History

The following data repository contains all of the obstacles used during copetition in American Ninja Warrior history. As a competition designer for the American Ninja Warrior reality television show, I wanted to become a better designer through learning about obstacle history. Through Jupyter Labs using Python and the Pandas Package, I was able to figure out the top 20 most used obstacles in competition from my original obstacle history .csv file. In figuring out this information, I am better equipped to design new, better, and more interesting course layouts to increase the show's innovation and viewer count. Additionally, athlete's competing in the show can be better equipped for new competition layouts now knowing probable obstacle sequences and popular obstacles used. Or, if you're a genuine fan of the show, this obstacle history and most popular obstacle data is very interesting to read through and look at.

This repository contains:
1. In-class tutorials. 
2. My first Python and Pandas Package test runs.
3. A .csv file of all American Ninja Warrior Obstacles used in competition.
4. Manipulated data from the original .csv file of obstacle history.
5. A visual representation of newly maniupaulated data from Jupyter Labs.

## Provenance:
As a fan of all sports related topics and one of the course designers for American Ninja Warrior, this data caught my eye as a data scientist and designer. I was reading through some sports data sets found on Github and found the complete history of all obstacles used in American Ninja Warrior competition. I coded and manipulated my data set on Jupyter Labs using the language of Python and the Pandas/Numpy Package. The data includes information such as the season number, location, round/stage, obstacle name, and obstacle order. 

## Purpose: 
The purpose for this data set is mainly to show the history of all obstacles used in competition. But also, my manipulated data set is aimed to show the top 20 most used obstacles in competition, in order to increase my course designing abilities and potentially set up athletes well for new competition sequences in their upcoming competitions and training.

## Potential
This repository is made for fans of The American Ninja Warrior competition interested in obstacle history/information. Any athlete training for the competition wanting to prepare for what the next competiton may bring. Other American Ninja Warrior competiton designers who want to know their history of creating obstacles in order to create difficult sequences of obstacles for the coming competitions. Lastly, this repository could be used for anyone interested in teaching themselves or learning more about coding or manipulating data sets they would like to experiment with.

## Data Visual: Top 20 Most Used Obstacles In Competition
This visualization shows the top 20 most used obstacles in American Ninja Warrior History, their names, and number of times used. This visual was created using Datawrapper and the data listed in the "ValueTable.csv" subset located in this repository.

This is a repository containing all of the material and data-sets from Reid Miller's Unit 3 project for Prof. Gotzler at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The original .csv file of American Ninja Warrior's Obstacle History was found at [Github's Awesome Data](https://data.world/ninja/anw-obstacle-history). These files have been taught and adapted from the great resources of UNC's Davis Library found at the [Research Hub](https://unc-libraries-data.github.io/Python/Intro/Introduction_CrashCourse.html). My data was manipulated through Jupyter Labs thanks Anaconda which was downloaded through UNC's public library resources found at [Setup](https://unc-libraries-data.github.io/Python/Setup.html). Thank you to Prof. Gotzler for making this possible.
